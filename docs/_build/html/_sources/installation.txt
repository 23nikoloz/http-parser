Installation
============

The most recent release is always available in the `cheeseshop`_ and can be
installed using `easy_install`_::

    easy_install python-restclient

Alternatly, you can also install the development version from 
our `Mercurial`_ repository::

    hg clone https://dev.e-engura.org/hg/python-restclient
    cd python-restclient
    sudo python setup.py install

Last command will install pthon-restclient as a package via setuptools. This
will make it available in your python path. Alternately you can copy or symlink
the simplecouchdb subdirectory into your site-packages directory or
anywhere in your PYTHONPATH.

You could also get source from  `Bitbucket`_ ::
