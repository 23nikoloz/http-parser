***************************************
What's New in python-restclient 1.1
***************************************


Transports changes
------------------

* :mod:`restclient.http` have renamed to :mod:`restclient.transport`. In
the same time all "clients" are now called "transports".

* urllib2 transport have been removed, Now httplib2 is used when pycurl
  isn't installed. This change was needed to simplify the code. And
  there was no need to rewrite another httplib2 transport but based on
  urllib2.

          :ref:`transports`

Support of File objects as body
-------------------------------

Now a body could be a File object. If you use httplib2 all the content
will be read before sending. Pycurl will send it as it read.


Url encoding
------------

By default all urls are utf8 encoded. But you could change default charset, safe characters and
decide that keys don't need to be encoded.
